== Age of Commercialisation
The path to commercialising quantum computing starts with producing hardware that is capable of supporting a large number of qubits. As of 2024, quantum computing remains in the early stages as reflected by how the market is currently dominated by hardware research, development, and deployment at 63.91% of the USD 1.42 billion quantum computing market @quantum_computing_market. Within this sector, there is stiff competition among the different implementations of quantum computing, including superconducting and trapped-ion methods (e.g. Google's 105-qubit superconducting Willow processor and IonQ's 11-qubit trapped-ion processor) @google_willow @ionq_processor. However, there is a strong case for QD implementation to be the quickest way to commercialisation given the QD's smaller size (compared to superconducting qubits) and seamless integration with existing semiconductor manufacturing processes as demonstrated by Intel's "Tunnel Falls" processor @intel_tunnel_falls. These properties make QD highly scalable, manufacturable, and cost-effective, with the capability to support a large number of qubits in a smaller form factor.

To push this technology towards commercialisation, a comprehensive ecosystem needs to be established, and part of this ecosystem is the an automated design process. Similar to generative design in Computer Aided Design (CAD), this thesis proposes a method to create initial QD device layouts using simple rectangular gate electrodes that takes a fraction of the time compared to manual processes. By leveraging an automated design process, there is the potential to rapidly build bespoke functioning QD devices for a wide range of applications.
