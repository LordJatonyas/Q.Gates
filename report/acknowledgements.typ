#heading(outlined: false)[Acknowledgements]

This thesis would not be possible without the support of a large number of people who have helped me. In particular, I would like to thank my supervisor, Natalia Ares. In a field of study completely unfamiliar to me, your unwavering patience and kindness has granted me the courage to explore the world of quantum dot devices.

I would also like to thank Marek Rychetsky who provided so much guidance on the topic of reinforcement learning in the context of quantum dot formation.

My friends who supported me throughout the thesis and the final year of my studies at Oxford: Ryan, Bang, Frank, Suyash, Yoonsang, Liam, Yansheng, Eve, Eric.
